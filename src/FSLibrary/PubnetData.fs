module PubnetData


// This module provides a set of distributions observed from pubnet. We last
// updated the distributions in October 2024. The apply duration and weight
// distributions are from replaying 5000 recent pubnet ledgers. The other
// distributions contain 3 months of soroban data starting from 6/24/24.
// The soroban distributions re represented as a list of (value, weight) pairs,
// where the weight is in parts-per-thousand.
//
// The intention is to use these distributions to enable testing of core under
// real-world conditions, with a particular focus on overlay performance. Given
// that the overlay is the primary focus, we've trimmed the tails of the
// instructions, read/write bytes, and data entries distributions as these tend
// to overload the relative low CPU counts we're able to allocate in
// supercluster. Instead, we make up for the impact of more cpu-intensive
// transactions by modeling apply-time using the apply duration and weight
// distributions. We do not trim the transaction size or wasm size distributions
// so that the overlay remains realistically stressed.

// Use the `histogram-generator.py` script in the `scripts` directory of the
// `stellar-core` repo to generate histograms from Hubble data.

// fixed as part of stellar-core issue #4231.
