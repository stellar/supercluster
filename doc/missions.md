## MissionHistoryPubnetParallelCatchup

Perform full catchup to Public Network, but in parallel to improve performance. Runs batches of recent catchup commands under the hood.

## MissionHistoryPubnetParallelCatchupExtrawide

Perform full parallel catchup to Public Network, but with increased parallelism.

## MissionHistoryPubnetParallelCatchupV2
Perform full catchup to Public Network in parallel, leverging Kubernetes for improved performance and robustness.

## MissionHistoryPubnetPerformance

Perform recent catchup to a fixed ledger and time bucket application and ledger replay portions of catchup.

## MissionHistoryTestnetMinimumCatchup

Perform minimum catchup to Test Network. Runs core `catchup current/0` command under the hood.

## MissionHistoryTestnetRecentCatchup

Perform recent catchup to Test Network. Runs core `catchup current/1001` command under the hood.

## MissionHistoryTestnetCompleteCatchup

Perform full catchup to Test Network. Runs core `catchup current/max` command under the hood.

## MissionHistoryTestnetParallelCatchup

Perform full catchup to Test Network, but in parallel to improve performance. Runs batches of recent catchup commands under the hood.

## MissionHistoryTestnetPerformance

Perform recent catchup to a fixed ledger and time bucket application and ledger replay portions of catchup.

## MissionVersionMixConsensus

Complete basic payments load generation on a network with mixed version images, old and new images are started with an existing ledger state (as opposed to starting from genesis).

## MissionVersionMixNewCatchupToOld

Complete catchup on new image to state generated by old image.

## MissionVersionMixOldCatchupToNew

Complete catchup on old image to state generated by new image.

## MissionProtocolUpgradeTestnet

Test protocol upgrade on a fork of Test Network.

## MissionProtocolUpgradePubnet

Test protocol upgrade on a fork of Public Network.

## MissionProtocolUpgradeWithLoad

Test protocol upgrade on a small network of nodes with load generation to produce non-empty ledgers at upgrade time.

## MissionDatabaseInplaceUpgrade

Upgrade core image with the existing state, perform any migrations.

## MissionAcceptanceUnitTests

Run stellar-core acceptance tests that take a long time.

## MissionSimulatePubnetMixedLoad

Simulate Public Network topology and throughput based on user-supplied distributions derived from network stats under load with a mix of classic and soroban traffic.

## MissionMaxTPSClassic

Stress test a network of simulated Tier1 topology with classic traffic and report maximum achieved throughput.

## MissionSorobanLoadGeneration

Test heavy Soroban load on a large network of nodes. This mission mostly focuses on high-bandwidth traffic, and its impact on SCP and overlay. Apply time is simulated to avoid noise from database backends.

## MissionSorobanConfigUpgrades

Test various upgrade scenarios for Soroban network configs (maximum transaction size, maximum transaction count, etc).

## MissionUpgradeSCPSettings

Test SCP timing configuration upgrades as defined in CAP-70.

## MissionSorobanInvokeHostLoad

Test resource-intensive InvokeHostFunction operations on a small network of nodes.

## MissionSorobanCatchupWithPrevAndCurr

Test catchup to ledger state that spans multiple protocols supporting Soroban.

## MissionMixedImageNetworkSurvey

Run a network survey with mixed version images on a small network of nodes.

## MissionSlowNodesNetwork

Run a network with a mix of fast and slow nodes. This mission allows to test interesting flooding and load shedding scenarios when some nodes are lagging behind.

## MissionMaxTPSMixed

Stress test a network of simulated Tier1 topology with a mix of classic and soroban traffic and report maximum achieved throughput.

## MissionMixedNominationLeaderElectionWithOldMajority

Run a network with a mix of nodes running the old and new nomination leader election algorithms. Contains a majority of nodes running the old algorithm.


## MissionMixedNominationLeaderElectionWithNewMajority

Run a network with a mix of nodes running the old and new nomination leader election algorithms. Contains a majority of nodes running the new algorithm.
